# Applied-Data-Science
Description: 
* Key data science concepts and their application to support data-driven approaches to problem solving. 

* Acquire fundamental skills covering the full data science pipeline, including the pre-processing, manipulation, integration, storage, exploration, visualisation and privacy. 

* Worked on techniques to transform raw data into advanced representations that will enable a deeper understanding of the original data:
  * Data ingress and pre-processing
  * Data storage and data management
  * Data transformation and integration
  * Data exploration and visualisation
  * Data sharing, privacy and anonymisation 
*  I gained practical skills in handling structured and unstructured data, gaining hands-on experience of software tools widely used in real-world settings.
